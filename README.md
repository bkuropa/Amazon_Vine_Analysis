# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Amazon reviews are a key influencer for customers and potential customers looking into products for sale on the website.  The Amazon Vine program was designed to "recruit" the most trusted reviewers active on the site to carry (hypothetically) a stronger influence for other users buying products.  This raises the question of whether or not the Vine program is truly influencing Amazon users.
After piping the dataset (in this case musical instruments) through an ETL process, the transformed data can be examined and a desision can be made (based on one dataset) as to whether the program is influencial or not.
